### `UploadsListProvider`

Provider for a list of items uploaded by the current agent. Note that this provider uses [`useKeyring`](./react-keyring.md#usekeyring) to obtain the current agent's identity.

Example:

```jsx
import { UploadsListProvider } from '@w3ui/react-uploads-list'

function App () {
  return (
    <UploadsListProvider>
      {/* Application pages/components */}
    </UploadsListProvider>
  )
}
```

You can optionally target a non-production instance of the upload service by setting the `servicePrincipal` and `connection` props on `UploadsListProvider`. The `servicePrincipal` should be set to the service's DID, and `connection` should be a ucanto `ConnectionView` to the service instance.

### `useUploadsList`

```ts
const [uploadsListState, uploadsListActions] = useUploadsList()
```

Hook to allow use of the [`UploadsListProvider`](#uploadslistprovider) value. The value returned is an `UploaderContextValue`:

```ts
export type UploadsListContextValue = [
  state: UploadsListContextState,
  actions: UploadsListContextActions
]
```

See [uploads-list-core.md](./uploads-list-core.md) for the definitions for [`UploadsListContextState`](./uploads-list-core.md#uploadslistcontextstate) and [`UploadsListContextActions`](./uploads-list-core.md#uploadslistcontextactions).
